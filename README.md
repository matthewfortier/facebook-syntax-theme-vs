# Visual Studio Facebook Syntax Theme
This theme is based on the Facebook Theme from [mbixby](https://github.com/mbixby/facebook-color-scheme) and adapted for Visual Studio.
The port is certainly not perfect because Visual Studio's text editor does not support the same scope names as Atom, VS Code, Sublime. etc.
